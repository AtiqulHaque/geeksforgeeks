""""LALU wanted to purchase a laptop so he went to a nearby sale.
There were n Laptops at a sale.
Laptop with index i costs ai rupees. Some Laptops have a negative price
â€” their owners are ready to pay LALU if he buys their useless Laptop. LALU
can buy any Laptop he wants. Though he's very strong, he can carry at most m
Laptops, and he has no desire to go to the sale for the second time. Please
help LALU find out the maximum sum of money that he can earn."""
